 * @dev Required interface for an Athanasia OTC underlying token sale.

 * This contract is initialized with the IAthanasia contract which is specific for this underlying token.
 * Athanasia enables NFT collection owners to lock in a portion of the mint sale price in form of a secondary underlying token.
 *
 * Typically during an NFT mint, configured value is deposited into this smart contract and an OTC purchase of the
 * underlying token. This is done to avoid price spikes during minting.
 * Alternatively, one may also choose to directly deposit the underlying tokens.
 *
 * This contract enables the OTC purchase of the underlying token. Only the IAthanasia contract may do the purchase, and only on
 * behalf of the collection which has been registered with IAthanasiaOtc.
